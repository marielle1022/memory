Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Marielle Riveros



2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/marielle1022/memory


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
memory2.mgrathena.info


4. Is your game functionality complete, with the appropriate logic implemented
as server-side elixir code? If not, what's missing?
The server-side functionality is not complete yet. Since the tiles cannot be
seen, I'm leaving in the IO.inspect(socket) statement in the games_channel.ex
file so that you can see that the tiles are properly shuffled, and do remain
linked to the same game name (I was able to view this running mix phx.server).

I'm struggling a lot with figuring out how to get the elixir and react
components to communicate -- conceptually, it's really tough for me to grasp.
At this point, I would be happy to get the tiles to appear.

I struggled for a long time with the error "join called too many times" and am
still unsure as to the exact cause -- the closest I can figure out is that it
might be related to comments within the render method, which I know doesn't
make much sense (Sangeetha, thank you for spending so much time helping me!),



5. Is your game properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yes.
